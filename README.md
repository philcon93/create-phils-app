# create-phils-react-app

A project to make creating a react app as easy as `npx create-phils-react-app`.

This is built in the same way as [create-single-spa](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa) but uses yarn workspaces instead of pnpm. This repository was a case study for me to learn how single-spa generates applications.
